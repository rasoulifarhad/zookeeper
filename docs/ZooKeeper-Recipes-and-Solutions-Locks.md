## ZooKeeper Recipes and Solutions

One of the most interesting things about ZooKeeper is that even though ZooKeeper uses asynchronous
notifications, you can use it to build synchronous consistency primitives, such as queues and locks.
As you will see, this is possible because ZooKeeper imposes an overall order on updates, and has
mechanisms to expose this ordering.

**Out of the Box Applications**: Name Service, Configuration, Group Membership

Name service and configuration are two of the primary applications of ZooKeeper. These two functions
are provided directly by the ZooKeeper API.

Another function directly provided by ZooKeeper is group membership. The group is represented by a
node. Members of the group create ephemeral nodes under the group node. Nodes of the members that
fail abnormally will be removed automatically when ZooKeeper detects the failure.

**Locks**
