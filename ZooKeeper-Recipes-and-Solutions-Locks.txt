## ZooKeeper Recipes and Solutions
#
#  One of the most interesting things about ZooKeeper is that even though ZooKeeper uses asynchronous 
#  notifications, you can use it to build synchronous consistency primitives, such as queues and locks. 
#  As you will see, this is possible because ZooKeeper imposes an overall order on updates, and has 
#  mechanisms to expose this ordering.   
#
## Out of the Box Applications: Name Service, Configuration, Group Membership
#
#  Name service and configuration are two of the primary applications of ZooKeeper. These two functions 
#  are provided directly by the ZooKeeper API.
#
#  Another function directly provided by ZooKeeper is group membership. The group is represented by a 
#  node. Members of the group create ephemeral nodes under the group node. Nodes of the members that 
#  fail abnormally will be removed automatically when ZooKeeper detects the failure.
