##
#
# This example implements a simple master-worker system. 
# 
#   - There is a primary master assigning tasks and it supports backup masters to replace the primary in the case it crashes. 
#
#   - Workers execute tasks assigned to it. 
#
#   - The task consists of reading the content of the task znode, nothing more. 
#
#   - Finally, clients submit tasks and wait for a status znode.
#
# Here is a summary of the code flow for each of the components:
#
## Master
#
#  1. Before taking leadership
#
#        1. Try to create the master znode
#
#        2. If it goes through, then take leadership
#
#        3. Upon connection loss, needs to check if znode is there and who owns it 
#
#        4. Upon determining that someone else owns it, watch the master znode
#
#  2. After taking leadership
#
#        1. Get workers
#
#             - Set a watch on the list of workers
#             - Check for dead workers and reassign tasks
#             - For each dead worker
#             - Get assigned tasks
#             - Get task data
#             - Move task to the list of unassigned tasks
#             - Delete assignment 
#
#        2. Recover tasks (tasks assigned to dead workers) 
#
#        3. Get unassigned tasks and assign them 
#
#        4. For each unassigned task 
# 
#             - Get task data
#             - Choose worker
#             - Assign to worker
#             - Delete task from the list of unassigned
#             
## Worker
#
#    1. Creates /assign/worker-xxx znode
#    2. Creates /workers/worker-xxx znode
#    3. Watches /assign/worker-xxx znode
#    4. Get tasks upon assignment
#    5. For each task, get task data
#    6. Execute task data
#    7. Create status
#    8. Delete assignment  
#
## Client
#
#    1. Create task
#    2. Watch for status znode
#    3. Upon receiving a notification for the status znode, get status data
#    4. Delete status znode
#
### RUN
#
## Step 1: Start ZooKeeper 
#
## Step 2: Start the master
#
#   java  org.apache.zookeeper.book.Master localhost:2181
#
## Step 3: Start a couple of workers
#
#   java  org.apache.zookeeper.book.Worker localhost:2181
#
## Step 4: Run a client
#
#   java  org.apache.zookeeper.book.Client localhost:2181
